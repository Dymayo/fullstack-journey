# Fullstack Notes & Experiments

Welcome to my personal **learning playground** for fullstack development.  
This repo is a collection of my **notes, code snippets, and small experiments** as I explore the fullstack world step by step.

---

## 📚 What You’ll Find Here
- Notes on key concepts (frontend, backend, databases, APIs, deployment, etc.)
- Mini projects & coding experiments
- References and resources I found useful
- Mistakes & fixes 

---

## 🎯 Purpose
This is not a polished project — it’s a **work-in-progress notebook**.  
The goal is simple:
- Learn by doing  
- Keep track of progress  
- Build a reference I can look back on  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack I’m Exploring
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, etc.  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, databases (SQL/NoSQL)  
- **Other:** APIs, authentication, deployment tools  

---

## 🚧 Disclaimer
Everything here is experimental. Code may be messy, incomplete, or totally broken — and that’s okay. This repo is about **growth, not perfection**.

---

## 🌱 Next Steps
- Expand experiments into small projects  
- Document tricky concepts in my own words  
- Gradually connect frontend + backend into fullstack apps
