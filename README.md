# Fullstack Notes & Experiments

Welcome to my personal **learning playground** for fullstack development.  
This repo is a collection of my **notes, code snippets, and small experiments** as I explore the fullstack world step by step.

## Frontend

I didn’t document much of my frontend journey, but most of my learning came from **The Odin Project**.  
After that, I built and iterated on my **own portfolio website**, which became my main practice ground.

## Backend

Here’s where I’m currently focusing and documenting more thoroughly:

- [**Databases**](Backend/Databases.md)
- **Node.js**

---

## Purpose

This repo isn’t meant to be a polished project. It’s a space for:

- Learning by doing
- Documenting key concepts in my own words
- Keeping track of progress as I connect frontend + backend into fullstack apps

You can find all the resources i used in the resources folderAll the resources I’ve used can be found in the **`/resources`** folder.
